# Working Graves

Yet another graves mod, I know. Working graves is a fabric mod that allows for the construction of graves that will be populated on player death. That means you can build a graveyard that will fill up as time goes on. Pretty cool huh?

Working graves is a server side mod. There is no need to install it on clients if you install it on your dedicated server. This means that, if installed on the server, it is completely vanilla compatible. Alternatively you can install in on the client for single player support.

## How to use

Follow these steps for success.
1. Place a sign with the text `hic portus animae`.
2. Right click the sign with a soul torch to underline it.
3. Place a barrel/chest under the sign (a 3x3x3 cube under the sign is checked) [optional]
4. ???
5. Die.

You can now go to the grave to collect your items.

## Server operators

You can see various debug information using the /graves command.
You can also use the `gravesRequireSoulTorch` gamerule to specify whether the soul torch is required for create a grave.
